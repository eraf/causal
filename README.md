## Done so far

- created function for calculationg RR, OR (for working on both data and inside tidyverse functions like `mutate` or `summarise`). Function name started with `d` means its meant for dataframe. But actually we need to do unit test on input data quality.



## TODOS:

- writing tests (both development-time and runtime or assertions)
- Chekcing for data other than wcgs
- writing bare minimum docs (using roxygen)
